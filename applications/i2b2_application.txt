I2B2 DATASET APPLICATION

Dataset Requested: De-identification Challenge Dataset

Project Title: MedAssist AI - Privacy-Preserving Clinical Assistant

Research Justification:
======================
The i2b2 de-identification dataset is essential for training and validating 
PHI detection models that meet clinical-grade accuracy requirements. Our 
research aims to achieve ≥99% recall and ≥95% precision for PHI detection 
in offline clinical AI systems.

Specific Research Questions:
===========================
1. Can quantized transformer models achieve i2b2 benchmark performance on CPU-only hardware?
2. How does Mojo acceleration impact PHI detection accuracy and speed?
3. What is the optimal model architecture for offline clinical deployment?

Technical Approach:
==================
- Fine-tune ClinicalBERT models using i2b2 annotations
- Implement 4-bit quantization for resource-constrained deployment
- Validate against established benchmarks and clinical standards
- Develop comprehensive evaluation metrics for field deployment

Data Usage Plan:
===============
Training Phase:
- Use annotated clinical notes for supervised learning
- Implement stratified sampling for balanced training sets
- Cross-validation using i2b2 recommended protocols

Evaluation Phase:
- Test against held-out validation sets
- Compare performance with published baselines
- Measure accuracy across different note types and specialties

Deployment Phase:
- Integrate trained models into offline clinical assistant
- Validate end-to-end PHI removal effectiveness
- Document compliance with HIPAA Safe Harbor requirements

Expected Timeline:
=================
Months 1-2: Data acquisition and preprocessing
Months 3-4: Model training and optimization
Months 5-6: Validation and benchmarking
Months 7-8: Integration and testing
Months 9-12: Clinical validation and deployment

Publications Plan:
=================
- Submit findings to JAMIA, IEEE TBME, or similar venues
- Present at AMIA, HIMSS, or medical informatics conferences
- Release open-source tools for clinical AI deployment
- Document best practices for offline healthcare AI
