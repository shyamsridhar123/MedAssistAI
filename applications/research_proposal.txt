1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
==================
MedAssist AI is an offline clinical de-identification and diagnostic assistant 
designed for healthcare workers in remote or resource-limited settings. The system 
combines Mojo-accelerated performance optimization with quantized transformer models 
to provide secure analysis of clinical notes for automatic PHI de-identification, 
summarization, and preliminary diagnostic support.

2. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
=====================
Primary Objectives:
- Develop high-accuracy PHI detection models (≥99% recall, ≥95% precision)
- Create clinical summarization capabilities for field healthcare settings
- Build diagnostic assistance models for resource-constrained environments

Secondary Objectives:
- Validate offline AI performance on consumer hardware
- Ensure HIPAA compliance through comprehensive de-identification
- Enable deployment in areas with limited connectivity

3. TECHNICAL APPROACH
====================
Architecture:
- Mojo-accelerated text preprocessing (35,000x speedup over Python)
- Quantized transformer models (4-bit/8-bit) for CPU deployment
- Gradio-based web interface for healthcare professionals
- Complete offline operation with no external API dependencies

Model Components:
- De-identification Engine: ClinicalBERT with 4-bit quantization (~400MB)
- Clinical Summarization: T5-Large/DistilBART with 8-bit + LoRA (~600MB)
- Diagnostic Assistant: MedGemma-4B-it with 4-bit QLoRA (~1.2GB)

4. DATA REQUIREMENTS
===================
For PHI De-identification Training:
- Annotated clinical notes with ground-truth PHI labels
- Diverse medical specialties and note types
- Validation against established benchmarks (i2b2 2014 dataset)

For Clinical Summarization:
- Clinical notes with corresponding summaries
- Longitudinal patient records
- Structured clinical outcomes

For Diagnostic Assistant:
- Clinical notes with associated diagnoses
- Symptom-diagnosis correlation data
- Evidence-based medical reasoning examples

5. INTENDED USE AND IMPACT
=========================
Target Users:
- Rural clinicians and healthcare providers
- Mobile health teams and field medical units
- Global health mission staff and NGO healthcare workers
- Healthcare researchers requiring HIPAA-compliant processing

Expected Impact:
- Improved healthcare accessibility in remote areas
- Enhanced clinical documentation efficiency
- Reduced diagnostic errors through AI assistance
- HIPAA-compliant data processing for research

6. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY
==============================
Technical Safeguards:
- Complete offline processing with no external data transmission
- AES-256 encryption for all local data storage
- Automatic secure deletion of temporary files
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance

Compliance Measures:
- HIPAA Safe Harbor method implementation
- Removal of all 18 specified identifiers
- Expert determination support documentation
- Institutional review and oversight

7. PUBLICATIONS AND DISSEMINATION
=================================
Planned Outputs:
- Peer-reviewed publications on offline AI for healthcare
- Open-source software components (where appropriate)
- Conference presentations at medical informatics venues
- Technical documentation for healthcare deployment

8. TIMELINE
===========
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Data acquisition and preprocessing
Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Model development and training
Phase 3 (Months 7-9): Validation and clinical testing
Phase 4 (Months 10-12): Deployment and evaluation

9. INSTITUTIONAL APPROVAL
