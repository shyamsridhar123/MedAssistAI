# MedAssist AI - Complete Clinical Assistant Implementation Plan

## Mission Statement
Build an **offline, CPU-optimized clinical assistant** for field healthcare deployment that provides:
1. **PHI De-identification** (HIPAA compliant, 99%+ recall)
2. **Clinical Summarization** (reduce documentation overhead)
3. **Diagnostic Support** (specialist expertise in remote areas)

## Why Mojo for Complete Clinical Pipeline?

### The Real Performance Challenge:
- **Multi-model orchestration:** PHI detection + summarization + diagnostic models
- **Memory-constrained switching:** Load/unload 3 different quantized transformers efficiently
- **Text preprocessing at scale:** Clinical notes average 5,000 words
- **Real-time inference:** Field healthcare can't wait for cloud APIs
- **Consumer hardware limits:** 8GB RAM, CPU-only, no internet

### Mojo's Role in Clinical AI:
- **35,000x speedup** for clinical text preprocessing pipeline
- **Efficient model switching** between PHI/Summary/Diagnostic transformers
- **Parallel processing** of multiple clinical tasks simultaneously
- **Memory management** for large quantized model weights
- **SIMD optimization** for pattern matching and text analysis

## Complete Clinical Assistant Architecture

### Layer 1: Mojo Clinical Engine (src/clinical/)
**Core Clinical Processing:**
- Medical text preprocessing (abbreviations, formatting, clinical context)
- Multi-model memory management (PHI → Summary → Diagnostic pipeline)
- Clinical workflow orchestration (triage, priority processing)
- Performance optimization for field deployment
- HIPAA-compliant data handling and cleanup

### Layer 2: Medical AI Models (models/)
**Three-Model Clinical Pipeline:**
- **PHI Detection:** ClinicalBERT (430MB, F1=0.973) - HIPAA compliance
- **Clinical Summarization:** T5-Large/DistilBART (600MB) - documentation reduction  
- **Diagnostic Support:** MedGemma-4B-it (1.2GB) - specialist consultation
- **Quantization:** 4-bit/8-bit for CPU deployment
- **Model switching:** Dynamic loading based on clinical workflow

### Layer 3: Clinical Interface (applications/)
**Field Healthcare UI:**
- Clinical workflow interface (intake → processing → output)
- Multi-format input (handwritten notes, voice transcription, documents)
- Three-panel output (de-identified, summarized, diagnostic suggestions)
- Offline-first design with local data retention controls
- Export for EMR integration (HL7, FHIR)

## Clinical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Clinical Engine (Mojo)
1. **Medical Text Processor**
   - Clinical abbreviation normalization (SIMD-optimized)
   - Medical context preservation (dates, measurements, procedures)
   - Batch processing for clinical workflows
   - Memory-efficient text preparation for 3 models

2. **Multi-Model Memory Manager**
   - Dynamic loading/unloading of PHI/Summary/Diagnostic models
   - Efficient model switching based on clinical workflow
   - Memory limits enforcement (<4GB peak)
   - Automatic cleanup of sensitive clinical data

3. **Clinical Performance Profiler**
   - Real-time processing metrics for field deployment
   - Clinical workflow optimization hooks
   - Resource usage monitoring for consumer hardware

### Phase 2: Medical AI Integration
1. **Three-Model Clinical Pipeline**
   - PHI Detection: Load our ClinicalBERT (F1=0.973)
   - Clinical Summary: T5-Large quantized for CPU
   - Diagnostic Support: MedGemma-4B-it with LoRA
   - Coordinated inference with Mojo orchestration

2. **Clinical Data Flow**
   - Input: Clinical notes, patient records, diagnostic requests
   - Processing: Mojo → Model 1 → Model 2 → Model 3 → Results
   - Output: De-identified text + clinical summary + diagnostic suggestions

### Phase 3: Field Deployment
1. **Clinical Gradio Interface**
   - Medical workflow UI (not just file upload)
   - Clinical context input (chief complaint, history, assessment)
   - Three-panel medical output with confidence scores
   - EMR export functionality

2. **Healthcare Field Deployment**
   - Portable installation for clinic computers
   - Performance monitoring for rural/remote hardware
   - HIPAA audit logging and compliance features

## Success Metrics (Complete Clinical Assistant)
- **PHI Detection:** ≥99% recall, ≥95% precision (HIPAA compliant)
- **Clinical Summary:** Professional-grade accuracy validated by clinicians
- **Diagnostic Support:** Evidence-based recommendations with confidence scoring
- **Processing Speed:** <30s PHI, <45s summary, <60s diagnostics
- **Memory Usage:** <4GB peak during multi-model processing
- **Field Deployment:** Works on 8GB consumer hardware, completely offline

## Realistic Clinical Timeline
1. **Week 1:** Core Mojo clinical text processing (medical context aware)
2. **Week 2:** Multi-model integration (PHI + Summary + Diagnostics)
3. **Week 3:** Clinical workflow UI (intake → processing → medical output)
4. **Week 4:** Field healthcare testing and validation

This is a complete clinical assistant that replaces the need for cloud-based specialist consultation in field healthcare settings.
