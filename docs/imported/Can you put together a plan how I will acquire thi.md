# Can you put together a plan how I will acquire this data and use it where in the process

Certainly. Below is a step-by-step data acquisition and integration plan for your MedAssist AI POC, indicating at each point how and where the selected datasets will be used in your de-identification, summarization, and diagnostic pipeline.

## 1. Data Acquisition Plan

### A. **Select and Register for Datasets**

- **Primary Datasets**
    - **i2b2 De-identification Dataset:**
        - Visit the i2b2 website and apply for access. This typically requires proof of research intent and a signed data use agreement (DUA).
        - Use for: PHI de-identification model training and evaluation.
    - **MIMIC-III / MIMIC-CXR:**
        - Complete CITI "Data or Specimens Only Research" training.
        - Apply via PhysioNet, agree to the data usage terms, and gain credentialed researcher status.
        - Use for: Clinical note de-ID and summarization. MIMIC-CXR for imaging/text multimodal applications.
    - **OpenDeID / MedCAT / Stanford AIMI:**
        - Register and download from respective project or institutional repositories (may require IRB or institutional affiliation).
        - Use for: Supplementary de-ID and NER tasks, or fine-tuning summarization.
- **Other Open Sources**
    - **Kaggle, Hugging Face Hub, OpenNeuro, MedPix, TCIA:**
        - Register account, accept dataset-specific licenses, then download directly.
        - Use for: Imaging pipeline validation, multimodal research, or secondary tasks.


## 2. Data Workflow Integration Plan

### B. **Mapping Data to Pipeline Stages**

| Pipeline Stage | Dataset(s) Used | Usage | Timing |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Data Preprocessing | i2b2, MIMIC-III, OpenDeID, MedCAT | Clean, normalize, format clinical notes; anonymize IDs if needed | Initial setup |
| De-identification Model Train/Eval | i2b2, OpenDeID, MIMIC-III | Train and evaluate transformer-based PHI masking; validate using annotated ground truth | Dev/pre-deploy |
| Summarization Model Train/Eval | MIMIC-III; MIMIC-CXR reports | Fine-tune and test clinical note summarizers | Dev/pre-deploy |
| Diagnostic Assistant Model | MIMIC-III diagnoses, Stanford AIMI, NIH CXR | Train/test LLMs for diagnosis suggestion from notes/reports | Dev/pre-deploy |
| Multimodal/Imaging Additions | MIMIC-CXR, TCIA, AIMI, MedPix, OpenNeuro | Pilot studies for future imaging workflows or joint tasks | Optional |
| Demo/Validation | Subset of each above | Run POC end-to-end tests, iteratively refine with sample data | Iteratively |

## 3. Practical Steps

### Step 1: **Dataset Registration and Download**

- Read dataset documentation and complete any ethics training/agreements.
- Download encrypted/archived datasets to a secure local project data folder.


### Step 2: **Preparation and Preprocessing**

- Use Mojo-accelerated Python scripts to:
    - Unpack datasets
    - Normalize formats (`.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.dicom`)
    - Filter notes/reports for length, completeness
    - Remove or further scramble any residual identifiers (beyond extant de-ID annotations)
- Create “train”, “val”, and “test” splits for downstream ML tasks.


### Step 3: **Pipeline Model Training/Evaluation**

- **De-identification:**
    - Train/fine-tune the PHI masking model using i2b2 as primary ground truth, supplement with OpenDeID and MIMIC admission/discharge notes.
    - Evaluate using standard NER metrics (precision/recall/F1).
- **Summarization:**
    - Use MIMIC-III discharge summaries, radiology reports, and corresponding “brief summary” annotations.
    - Fine-tune summarization models for concise, clinical output.
- **Diagnosis Assistant:**
    - Train/test using structured diagnosis labels in MIMIC-III or corresponding radiology annotations (e.g., CheXpert in MIMIC-CXR).


### Step 4: **Integration and Validation**

- Integrate models into the Mojo-Python backend.
- Test with held-out sets—ensure PHI is fully masked, summaries are coherent, diagnosis suggestions align with clinical context.
- Use both “closed test” (annotated ground-truth) and real-world (de-identified but unlabeled) notes for validation.


### Step 5: **Demo/POC and Iteration**

- Use samples from each dataset in the Gradio UI for demo/test scenarios.
- Collect user feedback and error analysis.
- Iterate on model and pipeline performance as needed.


## 4. Governance \& Good Practice

- **Document provenance** (source, accession date, DUA) for each dataset.
- **Track splits** (train/val/test) to avoid data leakage.
- **Secure storage:** Keep data encrypted at rest, restrict access to project team.
- **Compliance:** Ensure all data use is consistent with the original license/DUA.

**Summary Table – Data Acquisition and Utilization**


| Purpose | Example Dataset | Activities Explained |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| De-identification model training | i2b2, OpenDeID | Model fine-tuning, eval, initial benchmarks |
| General summarization | MIMIC-III, MedCAT | Training, fine-tuning, ground-truth eval |
| Diagnostic task development/test | MIMIC-III, Stanford AIMI, NIH ChestXray | Diagnosis prediction/classification |
| End-to-end POC with Gradio UI | Subset of all above | Demo \& field simulation |

This plan ensures your POC uses only legally and ethically sourced data, aligns datasets with your pipeline’s needs, and establishes clear steps for preparation, training/testing, and demo validation for the MedAssist AI application.
