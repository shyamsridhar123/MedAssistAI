# Can you help me understand what components run on mojo and what on python

Certainly! Here’s a clear breakdown of what components in your MedAssist AI project would run on **Mojo** and what would operate in **Python**, reflecting the optimal architecture for performance, maintainability, and ecosystem access:

## **Mojo Components (Performance-Critical / System-Level)**

These are the modules where Mojo’s ultra-fast execution, parallelism, and hardware optimization offer substantial benefits:

### **1. Text Data Preprocessing**

- Raw text cleaning, normalization, and tokenization (especially for large clinical notes)
- Sentence/paragraph segmentation, batch document reading
- Any streaming data input (e.g., handling multi-file batches, batched I/O)


### **2. Batch/Data Flow Orchestration**

- Efficient batch scheduling across CPU cores (true parallelism—no GIL)
- Vectorized, multi-threaded operations for simultaneous processing of multiple documents


### **3. Memory Management**

- Optimized allocation/deallocation of large text arrays and interim data between NLP tasks
- Buffer management to minimize RAM and temporary disk usage


### **4. Pipeline Coordination**

- High-speed passing of data between steps (de-identity → summarize → diagnose)
- Low-latency integration of model input/output processing


## **Python Components (Ecosystem, Models, UI, General Logic)**

These are components where Python’s rich libraries, extensive support, and ease of use remain most beneficial:

### **1. Model Inference and AI Pipelines**

- Loading quantized transformer models (using Hugging Face Transformers/PyTorch)
- Running actual de-identification, summarization, or diagnostic model inference
- Managing model quantization (BitsAndBytes, QLoRA, LoRA, etc.)


### **2. User Interface**

- Gradio-powered web interface for document upload, result display, export, and user controls


### **3. General Application Orchestration**

- High-level workflow, error handling, logging, and audit trail generation
- Exporting, saving, and managing outputs/downloads


### **4. Integration and Extensibility**

- Python’s ecosystem makes it easy to add/report to additional health data platforms, EHRs, or visualization tools
- Ancillary modules (e.g., PDF/text export, speech recognition, additional widgets)


## **How They Work Together (Interoperability Example)**

- **Mojo** handles the heavy lifting of reading, batching, and making text or image data “pipeline-ready” as fast as possible—handing off clean, structured data.
- **Python** receives this processed data, loads the AI models, and does the actual inference. Outputs (such as masked notes or summary text) are then returned to the UI, again potentially batch-coordinated or post-processed in Mojo if necessary.

**Example Simplified Workflow:**

```python
# Python (high-level workflow and model inference)
from mojo_processing import fast_batch_preprocess  # Mojo-accelerated batch I/O

# User uploads batch => Python triggers Mojo preprocessing
clean_batches = fast_batch_preprocess(list_of_uploaded_files)  # Mojo handles text normalization/tokenization

# Python: load quantized models (Transformers)
deidentified = deid_model(clean_batches)
summaries = summarizer_model(deidentified)
diagnoses = diag_model(deidentified)

# Python: hand results to Gradio UI, handle export, logging, etc.
```


## **Summary Table**

| Component | Mojo | Python |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Text normalization/tokenization | ✅ |  |
| Batch/buffer data management | ✅ |  |
| Multi-core orchestration | ✅ |  |
| Model loading \& inference |  | ✅ |
| Quantization, LoRA, etc. |  | ✅ |
| Gradio user interface |  | ✅ |
| File export, PDF generation |  | ✅ |
| Logging, error handling |  | ✅ |

**In short:**

- **Mojo:** All high-performance, bottleneck, and batch data flow tasks—where speed and multi-core use are critical.
- **Python:** Everything involving AI/ML libraries, the UI, integration, and general app logic—leveraging Python’s deep healthcare AI ecosystem and rapid development capabilities.

This modular “best of both worlds” approach ensures your MedAssist AI is blazing fast, resource-efficient, and easy to extend or maintain.
